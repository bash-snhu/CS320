## Reflection
- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- How do I approach designing software?

The most important part of a software’s design is the goal of the program: what it is able to achieve, but even more critically, that it services that goal with repeatability and accuracy; there is no point to automating a task if it cannot be done with predictable, desired results.

The needs of the user of the program must be assessed to find functional requirements—what the program actually needs to do. From there, the program must be written accordingly. Once a code base is built, it must be tested to verify that it accomplishes the goals it was written to facilitate. This is done efficiently with automated testing. Automated testing cuts down on the time it would normally take to assess and verify all code manually, while also enforcing consistency. Of course, automated testing is only as good as the developers who write those tests, but simple functional tests that are easy to parse can go a long way in checking to make sure the various parts of a program behave as they are supposed to without exception. One is able to test varying conditions easily, which goes a long way to making sure that software will reliably meet the demands of the client.
